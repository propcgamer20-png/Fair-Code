"""Fails if the generated site files (explainer pages, sitemap, OG images,
llms-full.txt) or the MCP results-frozen mirror (faircode/_results_frozen/)
are out of date relative to their sources.

Used by .github/workflows/build-explainers.yml. Runs its own fresh
regeneration internally (see "self-sufficient" below), so it no longer
depends on the workflow's own build_explainers.py/generate_og_images.py/
freeze_paper_results.mirror_for_mcp() steps having run first - though CI
still runs those first anyway, since the workflow's later steps assume a
built working tree either way.

Text-based generated files (explainer HTML, explainers-data.js,
sitemap.xml, llms-full.txt, faircode/_results_frozen/*.csv) are compared
byte-for-byte against the fresh regeneration via `git diff` - they've
never shown any platform-dependent variation, confirmed across two
separate incidents below.

One field is deliberately excluded from that byte-exact comparison:
build_explainers.py's `datePublished`/`dateModified` (JSON-LD) and
`<lastmod>` (sitemap.xml) are derived from `git log` on the source .md
file - which, for a brand new explainer, has no commit yet at the moment
it's first built (contributors necessarily build before their first
commit of that file exists, per CONTRIBUTING.md's own instructions), so
the very first commit's HTML is always missing them. A fresh regeneration
run afterwards - by this exact check, on the commit that just added the
file - correctly finds that commit and fills them in, which reads as
"stale" under a literal byte comparison even though nothing about the
source content changed. This isn't a staleness bug to catch, it's a
one-time, structural chicken-and-egg for any file's own introducing
commit, confirmed directly against the commit that added
explainers/equal-opportunity.md and explainers/intersectional-bias.md.
`_normalize_dates()` below strips exactly those fields (and only those)
before comparing, the same "verify what's actually meaningful, not what's
incidentally timing-dependent" approach the OG-image handling below
already takes.

OG PNGs are NOT compared against the fresh regeneration at all, by
design - two earlier attempts at that (byte-exact `git diff`, then a fixed
`compress_level`, then decoded-pixel comparison) all failed for the same
underlying reason: Pillow's bundled FreeType renders text with genuinely
different pixels on Ubuntu (CI) than on macOS (confirmed directly - a
macOS-side regeneration matches the macOS-committed original byte-for-byte
and pixel-for-pixel, while CI's Ubuntu-side regeneration of the exact same
inputs does not). That's not a staleness bug to catch, it's an inherent
cross-platform rendering difference with no fix available from either
side. What actually matters - and *is* platform-independent - is that a
current dark and light OG image exists for every explainer, is non-empty,
and has the right dimensions; `tests/test_generate_images.py` already
verifies the *generator* satisfies that in a temp directory, so this
script checks the same thing for what's actually committed.

This script is self-sufficient: it builds a fresh copy of the site itself
(via `git worktree`, with every currently tracked file's working-tree
content copied on top of the HEAD checkout, so uncommitted edits to an
already-tracked source file are what gets built) and compares the real
working tree against that regeneration - not against what's committed at
HEAD. Editing an explainer's .md without running `make build-explainers`
afterward is exactly the case this now catches; it no longer needs to run
after CI's own build_explainers.py/generate_og_images.py steps to be
meaningful, though CI still runs it there too.

Run locally:  python3 scripts/check_generated_files_current.py
Exit code:    0 = everything current, 1 = something is genuinely stale.
