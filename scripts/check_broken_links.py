"""Fail if a markdown in-page anchor or relative link points nowhere.

Checks every tracked `.md` file for:
  - `[text](#anchor)` links that don't match any heading on that same page
  - `[text](relative/path)` links to a file that doesn't exist
  - `[text](relative/path.md#anchor)` links where the anchor doesn't match
    any heading in that target file

External links (`http(s)://`, `mailto:`, ...) are out of scope - this is a
repo-integrity check, not a link-rot crawler, and making network calls in CI
would be slow and flaky.

The anchor slugifier below was reverse-engineered against every real anchor
link already in this repo (70/71 matched cleanly; the one holdout is a
literal `#link-to-section` placeholder inside a fenced code example in
CONTRIBUTING.md, which this script correctly ignores since it's in a fence)
rather than assumed from memory - GitHub's exact algorithm isn't public. The
rule that fits the evidence: lowercase, drop a hyphen that has a space on
both sides (a written dash, not a word-hyphen - this is what makes
"COMPAS - Criminal Justice Bias" slug as "compas--criminal-justice-bias"
while "Auto-Detection" keeps its hyphen), strip remaining punctuation, then
turn each remaining space into one hyphen. Treat this as a best-effort
approximation, not a guaranteed oracle - an unusual heading could still slip
past it in either direction.

Run locally:  python3 scripts/check_broken_links.py
Exit code:    0 = clean, 1 = at least one broken link found.
